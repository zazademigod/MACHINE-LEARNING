"""Build an Apply Discount Function
In this lab you will write a function that calculates the final price of an item after applying a percentage discount.

For example, if the price of an item is 50 and a discount of 20 is applied, the discount amount is 10, and the final price is 40.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named apply_discount.

The apply_discount function should take exactly two parameters: price and discount.

If price is not a number (int or float), the function should return the string The price should be a number.

If discount is not a number (int or float), the function should return the string The discount should be a number.

If price is less than or equal to 0, the function should return the string The price should be greater than 0.

If discount is less than 0 or greater than 100, the function should return the string The discount should be between 0 and 100.

If both inputs are valid, the function should calculate the discount as a percentage of the price.

The function should return the final price after applying the discount.

Tests:
Waiting:1. You should have a function named apply_discount.
Waiting:2. Your apply_discount function should take two parameters: price and discount.
Waiting:3. When apply_discount is called with a price (first argument) that is not a number (int or float) it should return The price should be a number.
Waiting:4. When apply_discount is called with a discount (second argument) that is not a number (int or float) it should return The discount should be a number.
Waiting:5. When apply_discount is called with a price lower than or equal to 0, it should return The price should be greater than 0.
Waiting:6. When apply_discount is called with a discount lower than 0 or greater than 100, it should return The discount should be between 0 and 100.
Waiting:7. apply_discount(100, 20) should return 80.
Waiting:8. apply_discount(200, 50) should return 100.
Waiting:9. apply_discount(50, 0) should return 50.
Waiting:10. When apply_discount is called with a discount of 100, it should return 0.
Waiting:11. apply_discount(74.5, 20.0) should return 59.6."""
